This is a collection of explanations for things that have been known to confuse newcomers to the Istio project.

### Why TF does this exist?

I offer training professionally and support the Istio community casually as time permits, and I wanted to have a detailed reference to link folks to when common questions come up.

### WTF should I do if this site answered my question?

### WTF should I do if my question isn't answered here?
